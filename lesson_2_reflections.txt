What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It gives you the ability to track history but does not automatically track. You need to initialize commit to track a snapshot.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is a middle man between the two. It allows you to incrementally track your changes and decide when the best time is to commit.
