Lesson Three Reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
As data backup in case your computer fails and to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
you might be working on something new or a fix on your local repository while a change in remote happened.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones within GitHub, but allows for additional tracking features by GitHub
Clones allow you to copy a repository to another place, locally or remote
Branches are a sub series of commits that branch off from the master branch of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To track the differences between the two masters and decide to merge them when you are ready.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
You can share the code files on a cloud server and edit it manually. It would be harder to track and compare changes. 
It would also be difficult to merge.
